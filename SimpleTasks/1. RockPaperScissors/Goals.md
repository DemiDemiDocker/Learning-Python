# Countdown Timer — Simple Step-by-step Tasks

## 1. Decide what the program does
Write a short sentence describing the program: for example, "Ask for a number of seconds, then count down to zero and show a final message."

## 2. Choose how the program starts
Decide what the program will say or show first (like asking for the number of seconds).

## 3. Plan how the program gets the time from the user
Decide the exact prompt the user will see when asked to enter the number of seconds.

## 4. Plan how the program keeps time
Decide that the program will wait one second at a time and update the display until the time reaches zero.

## 5. Plan how the time is shown on the screen
Decide what format to show the remaining time in (for example "MM:SS") and how often it updates.

## 6. Plan how the program ends
Decide what message to show when the countdown finishes.

## 7. Handle invalid user input (simple)
Decide what to do if the user types something that is not a number — for example, ask again or show a friendly error message.

## 8. Decide whether to clear or overwrite the previous time display
Choose whether the timer should overwrite the same line or print a new line each second.

## 9. Plan small usability touches
Decide on small extras: input hints, confirmation that the timer started, or a way to cancel early.

## 10. Test the program manually
Try different times (short and long), and test invalid inputs to make sure the program behaves correctly.

## Optional Extras
- Allow entering minutes and seconds separately.
- Add a sound or extra message when the timer ends.
- Add a visual cue (like blank lines) before the final message.
