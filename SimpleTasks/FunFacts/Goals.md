# Fun Fact Generator — Simple Step-by-Step Tasks

## 1. Decide what the program does
Write a short sentence describing the program: for example, "Show a random fun fact from the internet and let the user get a new fact by clicking a button."

## 2. Plan the layout
Decide what the page will show when the program starts:
- A heading or title
- A button to get a fun fact
- Space to display the fun fact

## 3. Get data from the internet
Plan to fetch a random fact from an online service using its web address (URL).

## 4. Extract the useful information
Decide which part of the data from the internet will be shown (for example, the text of the fact).

## 5. Display the fun fact
Decide how the fact will be shown on the screen:
- Font size
- Color
- Position

## 6. Make the button work
Plan a button that, when clicked, will:
- Clear the old fact
- Get a new fact
- Display the new fact

## 7. Allow repeated use
Decide that the user can click the button many times to get new facts.

## 8. Test the program
Check that clicking the button shows a new fact each time and that the layout looks correct.

## Optional extras
- Add images or emojis to the fun facts
- Change the font style or size dynamically
- Allow the user to copy or share the fun fact
- Fetch multiple facts at once and display them in a list
